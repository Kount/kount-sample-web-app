Simple e-commerce site that integrates Kount Services

This basic web application is a simplified representation of a standard customer purchase process including:

The web application integrates two of the Kount Fraud Detection services -- the Kount Data Collector and the Kount Risk Inquiry Service (RIS). It is written in PHP and uses the Kount RIS PHP SDK.

h5. Kount Data Collector

The Kount Data Collector is a service used to gather information for the customer provided by the device they use. The collected data includes: standard device fingerprints, IP address, Internet Service Provider, geo-location based on the customer's IP address and many more. The information obtained by the Data Collector service is stored for subsequent usage by Kount's fraud detection algorithms.

h5. Kount Ris Inquiry service

This tool can make automated decisions for the level of fraud-likeliness of customer purchases. It uses various parameters:
* purchase details -- items and item descriptions, prices, item quantities, etc.
* customer details -- customer provided data for name, e-mail address, billing and shipping address, customer age and gender, etc.
* information collected by the Kount Data Collector
